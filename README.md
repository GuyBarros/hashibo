Experimental Hashicorp IaaC Demos

This repo contains a few scattered demo resources for Hashicorp stack as well as a presentation deck for the entire suite created in Reveal.JS-Three.JS.

It uses a local oVirt4 cluster and a remote GCE option plus a few basic Packer and Nomad examples.  There is also a basic getting started with vault example.  All Hashicorp tools are installed in path via ~/bin/ but should work if they're in your path.
